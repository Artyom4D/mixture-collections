# Collections

This project demonstrates an alpha feature available in Mixture.

The Collections feature allows you to easily create, manipulate, paginate and query collections of data throughout a Mixture project. The feature has been inspired by Jekyll, but is designed to be more dynamic.
You can add more than one collection to a project and collection items can be authored in markdown, haml or liquid.

This project is a simple primer, it has two collections which are being used to demonstrate a portfolio and a blog.

Documentation for collections will be released very soon, follow @TeamMixture for updates.

Publish & Convert to HTML are temporarily disabled for projects using the collections feature while we take feedback.
